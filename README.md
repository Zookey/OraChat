# OraChat

I have implemented OraChat app based on user requirments. While I was implementing the app I tried to write clean code as much as possible. I have used MVP pattern to achive that.
# Libraries

- Dagger 2
- RxJava 2
- Retrofit 2
- Butterknife
- Mocikto

# UI

I have changed some UI elements to follow Material design guidelines.

- Changed how search funtionality is looking and working to match Android style, not iOS.
- Changed colors to match Ora Interactive branding and also material design.
